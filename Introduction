WELCOME TO THE COURSE:

HTML and CSS are the building blocks of the web.
HTML is is simple compared to CSS, so it's mostly CSS and we'll cover everything
from basic properties like colors and font sizes to the box model, flexbox, CSS grids, pseudo selectors,
So version control with git will will deploy a couple websites to services like Netlify and Vercel.
Purchase domain name & host a website

HOW THE WEB WORKS:

URL - Uniform Resource Locator (https://facebook.com)
https -- protocal
facebook.com -- dommain name

client -----------> server (Domain Name System)
       http request 
       http response

HTTP - hypertext transfer protocol

Communication language of the client & server
that allows browsers and other clients to talk to
servers and vice versa.

https --> secured data is encrypted
HTTP is stateless, which means that each request response cycle is independent from previous transactions.
When you refresh a web page, it's a completely different request than the last refresh and nothing
Now, sometimes you may see like a like a welcome message with your name, and it's there on every refresh. That name is being stored in something called a session, or through cookies on either the server or
Now when you make an HTTP request, you also get back a status code.
200 is a successful response.If you go to URL that doesn't exist, then that's a not found.
That's a 404 status code, and you've probably seen that before.

And once you get into JavaScript and you get into APIs and all that, this stuff becomes much more important.
There's also different types of requests that can be made with HTTP.

The most common is called a Get request.
This is when you're just getting data.
And this is the type of request that's made when you just visit a website.
But there's also post requests, which is when you're sending something to the data, typically through
a web form.There's also put requests for updating data and delete requests for deleting data.

And if you click on Netflix.com, this is basically the main page, the main request.
You can see the URL.
You can see the request method which remember is a Get request when you just simply go to a website.
And then the status code which is 200, which means everything is okay, and the remote IP address,
um, there's stuff down here like in the response headers.
